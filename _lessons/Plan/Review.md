### Review the burn plan

Once the development of a simple burn plan has been carried out (cross ref), it should contain all the information required for carrying out the burn safely and effectively. It is good practise to review the burn plan in the lead up to burning.

The burn plan includes:

| **Element of plan**             | **Check** |
| A statement of burn objectives   |  |
| Description of the area including the vegetation type, hazards and assets       |  |
| The constraints for burning (weather conditions) and fire season status           |  |
| The ignition pattern and technique    |  |
| Measures for protecting assets/values          |  |
| Resourcing requirements (equipment and labour) |  |
| Any health and safety issues (to staff, livestock or the public)        |  |
| Risk assessment         |  |
| Notifications required |  |

While burn plans are typically subject to an approval process via an FENZ officer in charge, its important that you validate the burn plan yourself and are comfortable in your own mind that:
* You are able and willing to carry out the burn based on your experience and the difficulty of the planned operation
* The constraints, proposed ignition patterns and techniques and resourcing requirements reflect what is stated in the burn objectives

Once the burn plan has been approved by FENZ, advanced preparations to ready the site for burning may be scheduled and undertaken. These include:
* Review your plan
* Complete boundary and other site preparations (e.g. fire breaks)
* Monitoring of approaching windows of weather
* Make advanced public notifications 
* Prepare resources (ensuring equipment is functional, the hiring/borrowing of additional equipment and staff are available).

To anticipate the arrival of suitable burning conditions, its important to:  ~(cross reference)~
* Monitor the weather out to 6-10 days ([link to met service](https://www.metservice.com/))
        Regular monitoring of weather factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction) at your proposed burn site in the lead upto your burn window, will help establish get a better idea of what weather to expect on the day
* Monitor the vegetation (fuels) and their moisture conditions
        Fuel moisture conditions are fundamental to determine whether fuels will burn, and if so how rapidly and intensely.
* Consider the direction and speed of the fire during the burn 
* Consider smoke direction and dispersion in relation to this weather

_Self Check:_

_Qu. Has the burn plan been approved?_
_Qu. Will the burn plan allow you to meet the objectives of your burn?_
_Qu. Will the burn plan result in a safe operation (staff and reducing escapes)?_

>__Activity:__ Reviewing the following two burn plans, make an assessment on whether they contain all the elements.  Compare between the two plans. Which one is poorly written, and what does it need to improve it.

### Learning outcome: 
Know why it is important to review a burn plan in the lead up to burning, and what advanced preparation is required to ensure you can burn on the day.
