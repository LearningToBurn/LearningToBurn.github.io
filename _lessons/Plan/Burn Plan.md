### Planning a Burn 

Once it has been decided that burning is warranted, careful planning, including consultation with all interested parties, agencies and neighbouring landowners is essential in developing a prescribed burning plan. Burning should only be carried out in accordance with a written burn plan. The plan should address all relevant issues raised by this code and relevant legislation. A good plan will help you achieve your burn objectives, prevent the escape of your fire, and keep everyone and the environment safe.

### What is a Burn Plan?

The burn plan details what, where and when you are burning as well as the mitigations that are in place to help prevent fire escapes.  A burn plan describes the following:
* the objectives of the burn and the expected results.
* the area, including vegetation, assets and values. Include how these will be protected. The burn plan needs to identify whether there are values/assets vulnerable to smoke and consider desirable weather patterns for directing fire and smoke away from valuable assets and weather contributing to poor smoke dispersal
* The burn plan specifies, either in words or by a map, the parcel of land to be burned, the landowner(s), and owners of adjacent land not included in the burn.
* The burn plan specifies the required governmental permits and lists those who must be notified on the day the burn is to take place. 
* The locations and characteristics of all fire breaks (fire control lines) are given, as well as strategies for containment of fire within the burn unit. 
* Ensure your burn plan considers safety, this includes escape routes and safety zones. These should be prepared and identified well in advance of the day you are burning
* Any preparations of the burn unit needed before the burn can take place should be indicated, including a list of fire sensitive elements within or near the burn unit that must be protected. 
* The burn plan should state the personnel needed, as well as their qualifications and duties. 
* The burn plan also lists the equipment needed to conduct the burn. 
* The expected progress of the burn should be stated, and a contingency plan identified for a burn not proceeding as expected. 
* Requirements for containment of the site after the burn is completed (mop-up) should be listed. 
* The burn plan must outline the weather conditions which must be met if the burn is to take place. It is vital to have the best available weather reports. Local radio and television stations are too general to be of much use. A detailed report giving predicted wind speed and direction, relative humidity or dew point, cloud cover, and temperature is necessary.
* Ignition patterns and techniques.
* Health and safety issues (for your staff and the public).
* Identifying any hazards and risks.
* This form also contains templates to use to capture fire and weather observations on the day of and during the burn.
* The neighbours and the local fire department should always be notified of an upcoming burn.


### Why do you need one?

A burnt plan identifies both environmental and safety impacts and tries to mitigate these adverse outcomes from a burn off (see figure below).   A well-written prescribed burning plan accomplishes several positive things: 
    * it forces us to thoroughly plan a burn; 
    * it forces us to understand and define the conditions when fire can accomplish our goals;
    * it forces us to understand and define the conditions when it is NOT safe to burn; 
    * it makes us prepare contingencies for problematic situations that might develop; 
    * it helps us recognize our knowledge, equipment and preparation limitations for a prescribed burn; and 
    * it helps minimize our liability when we adhere to the plan because it demonstrates farmers are knowledgeable about fire and do not negligently apply this tool.

>If you have a burn plan, it does not absolve you from responsibilities if you have no conduced a burn in a safe manor. You can still be prosecuted if the fire is not conducted in a safe manor and you have not taken adequate measure to protect your staff, livestock or the public from the effects of your burn off.

Complete this form when you’re planning a complex land clearing burn, to ensure all factors have been considered. For complex land clearing burns, this plan must be approved by the Principal Rural Fire Officer or delegate. This plan includes the following sections (**not all sections may be applicable for your burn**):

| **CONTENT**             | **WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED** |
| Part A: Plan contents   | This is a checklist for you to ensure you have completed all the information you need.  You will need to append some maps. |
| Part B: Approvals       | You will need to get sign off from the landowner, person responsible for the burn and the Principal Rural Fire Officer. |
| Part C: Contact and property details           | Name of the landowner, name and contact details for the person responsible for the burn, and the property legal description. |
| Part D: Burn details    | Outline your burn objectives (how much you will burn, type of burn, the fuel types, the topography) and location of the burn. |
| Part E: Surrounding vegetation          | What vegetation types are found on neighbouring lands |
| Part F: Perimeter control lines | Identify what fuel breaks you have and where. ~ Refer What is a fuel break |
| Part G: Nearest water points        | Identify locations of water sources for any suppression needs |
| Part H: Light-up details         | How are you going to light, this includes what tools you will use and light up pattern (include a map). IdentifY the preferred range of weather conditions and time of the day for safe burning. Identifies how you will keep people safe by planning an escape routes for them to travel to a safe zone (include on a map). |
| Part I: Special conditions | Show that you have identified what needs protecting and how you are going to protect it.  Include a map if necessary. Identify areas that could be impacted by fire or smoke and signs that could be placed on a road. Include this on a map if necessary. Identify who you need to notify that you are burning and their contact details. This will make it easier on the day to remind you who to call. This also prevents FENZ to send out suppression resources when the public see smoke. |
| Part J: Personnel resources required        | Identify who is going to staff the burn and what roles they will undertake |
| Part K: Equipment required        | List your ignition and suppression resources that you have onsite |
| Part L: Reserve resources       | Write down names and the contact details for any onsite or nearby resources that can be called upon if needed. |
| Appendix A: Communications Plan        |This will help you determine how you will talk with multiple staff when you can’t see them. This also outlines key contact numbers (e.g. neighbours, fire officers and medical centres). |
| Appendix B: CIMS incident command structure      | Only required for a complex high-country burn, when you require a lot of staff to help. |
| Appendix C: Fire and weather behaviour pre-burn observations        | Fill this in on the day of the burn before you light up. It can help you determine whether the burn conditions are met. |
| Appendix D: Fire weather observations during burning        | Take the plan with you to document weather before, during and after the burn. If things go wrong this can help explain the why. |

_Self-Check: Think about a burn you have conducted in the past; did you consider the above points? Reflect on how these points may have helped assist you with previous burn experiences._
