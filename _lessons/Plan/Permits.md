### Your responsibilities and why you need one

Does a permit clear me from responsibility for a fire if it escapes?  
The person who lights a fire is always responsible for it whether they have a permit or not.  Failure to obtain a permit or proper authorization is an offence  and can result in a conviction.


No matter what the fire season is, you still need to comply with any council bylaws and regional council requirements relating to smoke nuisance and discharges to the air, even if you are issued with a fire permit from Fire and Emergency.
