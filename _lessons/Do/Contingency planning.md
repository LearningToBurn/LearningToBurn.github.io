### Contingency plans – taking precautions ‘just in case’

> __Ask "What if?"__ 
* What if we had an injury?
* What if we had an escape?
* What if the weather changes?

**Have a backup plan**
Even with the best planning and preparation, things can still go wrong. It is important therefore to have a back-up plan for all likely eventualities.

Contact details for the local emergency services, medical centres and pharmacy, along with neighbours and staff next of kin should be part of a contact sheet submitted with your burn plan. 
Keep the burn plan and attached contact plan readily to hand when burning, to consult in case things do go wrong.

In the event that Fire and Emergency NZ need to be mobilised, their job will be made much easier if you have provided them with a copy of the burn plan, and have updated this as required to suit the relevant conditions. They will need information about ownership boundaries, assembly points, watercourses, suitable reservoirs and the location of tracks and access roads. It is important to state whether access routes are only walking width, or if can be used by fire trucks or smaller vehicles (utes etc.). On arrival, Fire and Emergency NZ will take control of the incident and may request the assistance of those present, where operatives are suitably trained and equipped.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Personal protective clothing is a must when burning. Wear wool or cotton clothing. Do not wear synthetic materials as these can melt and cause severe injuries. Create layers of clothing without tucking in, e.g. trouser legs over boots to prevent embers catching in clothing. 
It is a good idea to have a checklist that will help you keep track of what PPE you will need before going to a burn. At a minimum, PPE should include items such as:
*	leather or woollen gloves
*	a hat or beanie (preferably brimless and close fitting)
*	hardhats, if burning off scrub or forest
*	goggles (ensure these have been sprayed with anti-fogging mist)
*	a handkerchief or bandanna for smoky conditions
*	cotton or lightweight merino knitwear undergarments and socks
*	long trousers
*	a shirt, woollen jersey or jacket (non synthetic) – nomex or bush shirt, or light brush-cotton shirt.
*	and leather boots. – Ensure embers cannot fall inside the neck.

Unless properly clothed, not only will the chance of sustaining a burn injury be high, but the effectiveness in the work to be done will be much reduced. The body needs protection from flying sparks and heat, while at the same time allowing freedom of movement and the ability to work quickly and efficiently.
There is a need to cover limbs and face (arms, hands, face and torso especially) while protecting from overheating. As much of the body as possible should be covered to protect from radiant heat and ash.  While a large range of fire-fighting specialist apparel is available, and excellent from a protection point of view, many farmers have found these restrict movement, contain body heat and generally can make quick movement through vegetation when conducting ignition rather difficult. Firefighting apparel is often for fire suppression rather than the fire ignition tasks associated with controlled burn offs.
Therefore, a balanced pragmatism is needed in choosing appropriate clothing for the weather and conditions, as burning off vegetation requires a person to move fast and keep going through the vegetation, without clothing and equipment encumbering you.
Light cotton shirts over woolen singlets, woolen beanies, bandannas, etc. are ideal, but should be used in conjunction with heavier fabrics. Cotton can also become cold when wet.
Shorts over woolen tights, or close fitted trousers (polycotton or moleskin) will protect legs. In addition, there is the need for good sturdy boots (not gumboots).
Outer clothing must not be too tight fitting, however, as it should be easily removed if someone finds themselves alight. 

### Vehicle safety

All vehicles on the job must be treated as emergency vehicles and:
*	Be roadworthy (warrant of fitness standard)
*	Be parked with the nose facing the exit
*	Be parked with a clear exit route (i.e. not blocked in by other vehicles or equipment)
*	Be parked in such a manner that other vehicles are able to pass by easily.
*	Have sufficient fuel to get to an emergency service
*	Have the keys in the ignition, or the location of the keys known to ALL staff and relatively handy
*	Avoid having petrol canisters or fuel exposed to ember strike.

If personnel are required to drive during the burn, be aware of smoke:
*	Keep cab windows wound up
*	Switch on the lights and blow horn occasionally
*	Avoid having flammable material exposed in the vehicle
*	Drive at a safe speed.

### Contingency Planning

**Plan** for what is likely to happen if the fire leaves the prescribed burn area:
*	Does adjacent land contain highly flammable vegetation? Have you left adequate firebreaks? 
*	Have you notified neighbours of the intention to burn, so they are ready to leave if an escape occurs? Nearby homes may be occupied. Pets and livestock may suddenly be in the path of fire. 
*	What direction will the smoke blow? If the wind changes the new trajectory of the fire may cause it to lay smoke over roads.
*	Are staff aware of the most likely escape zones? Point out the areas around the burn perimeter where a fire is most likely to escape or where homes or other valuable structures are nearby. Extra vigilance is required to ensure containment when these areas are alight.
*	Are staff aware not only of safe zones, but what the operating procedure will be should a fire escape or a person get injured? Outline this during the pre-burn briefing. Identify multiple safe areas (safety zones) where crew members can go if a fire escapes and communicate how to get there.
*	For larger areas or burning difficult terrain, have a tanker or helicopter on standby “just in case”

Make the burn plan, contact details, and emergency procedures able to be implemented quickly, if things should not go to plan:
*	Check to see that each vehicle has a copy of emergency notification phone numbers.
*	Make sure your crew carries a First Aid kit.

**Plan** for equipment failure:
*	Spare burners are a good thing to have handy for quick replacement if there is a failure in any of those being used. A breakdown or delay in lighting up one area of the fire ignition plan may be a serious handicap or even affect the overall fire direction.
*	Burners that leak fuel onto operators clothing should be avoided, especially backpack spray units. Leaks from hose connections and valve failure are particularly risky around open flame. Consider using ignition tools that won’t drip fuel onto clothing. i.e. A tin can with rag dipped in fuel rather than a liquid fuel source.

**Plan** for the weather to change, and know the required conditions for safe burning:
*	Ensure the wind conditions and direction, along with air temperature are suitable prior to ignition. This usually meant a light breeze, (or very calm conditions if backburning), air temperatures of around 10 degrees and ensuring dewfall or rain was forecast at night following the fire, and waiting till later in the day to ensure the weather pattern is well established.
*	Check the forecast hourly throughout the day in case weather patterns change

One cannot rely on vegetation type or rules of thumb to keep the fire contained – Fire can still travel in lighter fuels, and is known to move under snow.


_Self check_
*	_What are some things that might go wrong with your planned burn?_
*	_What contingencies could you put in place to mitigate these?_

Planning for the worst can decrease reaction time, increase fire service speed and efficiency in handling the escape, and decrease the negative consequences of an escaped fire. Early intervention can keep a small escape from becoming a raging wildfire.


### Learning outcome: 

Know what aspects may stop your burn from progressing safely, and how to ensure mitigation tools and actions are planned for if/when these might eventuate.
