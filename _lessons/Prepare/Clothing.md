### Why do you need to wear protective clothing?

Working around fire can be hazardous. Therefore, the use of appropriate clothing is an important and essential tool in decreasing your chance of serious injury.
Protective clothing is for your own personal safety and to protect other staff working with you on the burn, and should always be worn when you are undertaking a prescribed burn. Make sure that others are also wearing appropriate clothing before lighting the match.

Some of the hazards include:
* Exposure to flames and radiant heat resulting in a burn
* Smoke and dust irritability, and low visibility
* Slips, trips and falls
* Sunburn
* Windburn
* Physical injury i.e. scratches, abrasions 
* Noise from helicopters, bulldozers or when using noisy pumps or farm machinery

### What clothing should you wear?

Unlike firefighting that requires thick clothing, gloves, heavy boots and respirators because they are in direct contact with close radiant heat when fighting the fire. Farmers are instead moving quickly through the vegetation at the base of the fire where there is less intensity and radiant heat. Because of this, a different approach to clothing is needed.

All land managers are required under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2015(?) to provide staff with appropriate protective clothing while undertaking a prescribed burn operation. If you are in charge of the burn on the day you must ensure all people employed are appropriately clothed. It is part of your responsibility to ensure a safe working environment.

Factors to consider in choosing clothing 
* Is it made from natural fibres?
* Is it the right size, does it fit correctly?
* Is it in good condition? (no holes, tears or spots where fuel has spilt)

Areas that you must have some protection for include:
* Feet 
* Legs
* Hands and arms
* Torso
* Head / face

### Essential clothing

**Cotton or woollen undergarments** 

Whatever you wear beneath your protective clothing should allow you to work comfortably. For your own protection shirts, pants, socks and underwear should contain as little synthetic material as possible. 
*	Natural fibres such as wool and cotton provide good resistance to fire.
*	Avoid synthetic material (including polypropylene and nylon) as these may melt and adhere to your skin. 
*	Could include a cotton t-shirt and shorts or singlet beneath outerwear.

**Protective outer clothing** 
Provides a barrier that can absorb heat and prevent your skin from burning, and other injuries (abrasions etc.)
*	made of natural fibre, such as cotton or wool or fire-resistant material
*	loose fitting to allow air flow and cooling by reducing body heat. 
*	covers the body including legs and arms (ankle to wrist). full-body-cover protection, including protection of the interface areas such as between sleeve cuff and gloves, thus providing maximum protection from radiant heat
*	bright coloured clothing can make you stand out to others when in the field and during smoky conditions
*	do not tuck clothing in – instead create layers so hot material you come into contact with doesn’t catch in your clothing (e.g. don’t tuck the bottom of trousers into socks, let the trouser leg fall over the outside of your boot)
Options include:
*	One- or two piece overalls. Note- ensure if purchasing from a Farm supply outlet that these are cotton, not synthetic.
*	Alternatives to overalls could include a long sleeved cotton shirt or woollen jumper
*	with cotton pants or light cotton jeans, or woollen trousers or leggings with cotton shorts so legs and arms are fully covered. 

**Leather work boots with woollen or cotton socks**
Boots worn during prescribed burning should have the following basic properties:
*	be made of leather or similar material that can withstand conditions at a fire and provide insulation for the feet (not sneaker style walking boots with ‘breathing panels’)
*	have a heat resistant sole with good grip.

Other optional items can include:
*	Cotton hat or woollen beanie.
*	Sun glasses
*	Hair tied back if long.
*	Earmuffs or ear plugs when operating in a noisy environment (near pumps, aircraft or noisy machinery)
*	Leather gloves (Use gloves that allow you to maintain good dexterity)
*	Cotton handkerchiefs or bandannas can help protect airways from dusty environments, and the neck from sunburn.

### What shouldn’t you wear/use

* 	Shorts and short-sleeved shirt as outerwear
* 	Synthetic clothing such as nylon and polypropylene, can melt at high temperatures and cause serious injury
* 	Clothing which restricts normal movement
* 	Protective clothing or equipment which may restrict vision
* 	Steel toe cap boots increase danger of burning skin as the steel toes can heat up fast and hold heat for longer, causing severe burns.


### Care & maintenance of clothing

* 	Routinely examine your protective clothing for wear and tear. Checking your clothing after each burn, allows time for repairs or replacements before you next head out. Your personal safety may depend on it functioning correctly. Routine examinations should include checks for:
        *	physical damage such as rips, tears, cuts, damage to seams and/or other connections non-functional or missing
        * thermal damage such as charring, burn holes, melting or change in colour
* 	No leaked fuel on the clothing

_Self check_
* _What clothing do you normally wear when conducting a burn-off?_
* _Is the clothing suitable for the burn you will be undertaking?_

>__Activity:__  check the condition of your protective clothing and identify any items needing to be replaced or repaired prior to the burn.
