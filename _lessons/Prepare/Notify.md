### Why you need to notify

So that:
* people can take precautions and adequately prepare for any potential impacts of smoke and fire. 
* people don’t get alarmed and know what is going on.


The smoke from larger burn offs can reduce visibility, in a similar manner to fog, requiring drivers to reduce speed or to pull to the side in episodes of very severe visibility reduction.
* In some instances, roads have been closed due to the low visibility caused by the smoke. Where driving visibility is reduced due to smoke, the largest risk to motorists appears to be the potential for rear ending vehicles in front that have slowed their speed or stopped due to smoke presence.

### Who you need to notify

Notify the people you have identified and contacted during the planning phase as needing to be aware of the burn, including:
* Fire and Emergency communication centre so that they are aware of the burn taking place if members of the public call to notify of fire or smoke
* Let the local fire officer know what you’re doing and that you’re prepared for what you’re going to undertake. 
* Helicopter operator on standby for fighting any escaped fire, where appropriate.
* All occupiers of land adjoining the land containing the area to be burnt
* Notify neighbours about the burn well in advance and make a special effort to contact anyone with respiratory ailments (Asthmatics, rest homes, and hospitals) so they can take precautionary measures.
* Close all windows and doors during the day and night of the burn to reduce their exposure to smoke.

* Notify other agencies such as Air Traffic Control if you are burning near an air strip. If your burn requires the closure of a major road way, you may need to contact NZTA. If you anticipate a road visibility problem, ask for assistance with signage. Consider a public service announcement to use an alternative route for a given time.

* Post some smoke-warning signs to warn the public of areas where some may create a hazard to driving. Man these areas (day and night) to ensure smoke is not creating a safety concern, be prepared to move the signs as needed. For unexpected serious reductions in road visibility, stop traffic until smoke clears. You don’t want any traffic accidents on your conscience.


Implementing planned public safety for areas that have access routes for walking, hiking or fishing. This includes the:
* Placement of temporary barriers to control public access to the burn area. 
* Placement of warning or advisory signs at entry points or intersections
* Check the burn site to ensure no member of the public are present prior to light up

### Advice from Fire and Emergency New Zealand

Contact Fire and Emergency so we know what you are intending, and we can provide advice. Even if your burn is in an open fire season, there are still risks when lighting a fire and we are here to help.

Fire and Emergency can provide free advice to help you achieve the result you want safely. Receiving advice does not take away your responsibility for the fire but use of our expertise can minimise your risk and the adverse consequences of your burn.

Larger burns may take several months to prepare, so it’s important to get in touch with us early.
Contact details for your local Fire and Emergency office are available on the [checkitsalright](https://www.checkitsalright.nz/) website.

### What sorts of information a notification should include

The information in a notification could include:
* Who is conducting the burn
* When and where the burn is proposed
* The purpose of the burn
* Potential impacts of the burn (smoke and access restrictions)
* Contact details for further information

>_Activity:_
* Make a list of all persons and organisations that should be notified of your prescribed burn in advance or on the day of the burn.
* Identify how each contact should be made and by whom.
* Practise writing a public notification explaining the reasons for the burn and if you expect to produce a lot of smoke, encourage those with respiratory problems to stay indoors and keep windows closed. 

### When you need to notify

In the burn plan preparations stage:
* Consultation with neighbours and fire agencies could be undertaken during the planning process to provide opportunity to incorporate any additional issues, local knowledge or specialist insights into the burn plan. 
* In some cases, your neighbours may be interested in incorporating part of their property in the burn operations, which may provide better access options and improve burn outcomes. Coordination and sharing resources can lighten the load on you and your neighbours and the community (smoke nuisance can be restricted to less days)

In the lead up to the burn:
* The importance of timely and well-worded public notifications (be it through letter-box drops, signage and text messages) prior to prescribed burning is recommended in allowing residents to make any necessary preparations
* A traffic management plan is required where fire and smoke will impact major roads. Traffic management is likely to require careful planning.

* Early notification of the burn operator and other staff involved will help ensure that you have people available and ready. There can be competition for aerial resources for complex burns.
* Notification of additional resources (helicopters) so that they can be in attendance or ready to respond if necessary to protect assets

* Establish responsibility for burn-day contacts and how they will be made.
* As a matter of courtesy, it’s important to contact your neighbours and other affected parties on the day prior to your burn. Make direct contact with all homes and businesses in the area likely to be impacted by the burn. 

* Ensure public safety for areas that have access routes for walking, hiking or fishing. This includes the: placement of temporary barriers to control public access to the burn area, or placement of warning signs at entry points or intersections

On the day of the burn:
* follow the details of the traffic management plan, if one has been created.   Signs should be used to notify passers-by of a burn in progress. At a minimum, two signs are needed, at opposite ends of the road or highway adjacent to the burn unit. The signs should be left in place until there is no longer any smoke or glowing coals visible. . For main road traffic you may need staff or contractor to manage the roadway.
* Carry out notifications to those who are listed in your burn plan. Make direct contact with all homes and businesses in the area likely to be impacted by the burn
* Contact FENZ comms and let them know you are burning today so that they are not sending out resources to 111 calls unnecessarily
* There may be a requirement on your permit to notify (by text message) your local fire officer when you are about to light up.
* Check the burn site to ensure no member of the public are present prior to light up
* Notify FENZ comms and your local officer that the operation has ended, and the fire is fully extinguished.

_Self Check: think back to a burn you conducted, did you have any issues with smoke or fire impacting others. What did mitigations did you take, or could you have taken?_
