It’s important to have a checklist and schedule activities to ensure that everything is in place before you conduct the burn so that you are adequately prepared. 

In the lead up to and on the day of the burn, there are several tasks that must be performed.  [Click here for the printable version](https://github.com/LearningToBurn/LearningToBurn.github.io/blob/c9ae6da034fc3301c88de0013896fa279a33b1d7/Module%209_form.pdf)
