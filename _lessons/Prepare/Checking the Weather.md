**Weather**

Weather is an important factor to consider when planning your burn. It can change quickly and can catch you out. 
*	Up-to-date weather observations and forecasts are crucial for determining fire danger and fire behavior [Click here](https://fireweather.niwa.co.nz/)


### Obtain the latest weather forecast

It is important to obtain the latest weather forecast for the area in the morning. You need a current and long range forecast, obtained no more than 12 hours before light-up.

<br />

**Do not** light up if:
*	there are strong winds or when strong winds are predicted. Generally, fires should not be lit with a wind greater than 25km/h (small branches are moved). Your permit may specify a maximum wind speed.
*	smoke drift from the fire could cause nuisance to nearby towns, residences or compromise traffic safety on roads.
*	the wind is blowing towards adjacent forestry blocks, public conservation land, buildings, or other sensitive environments.

<br />

Continue monitoring the weather forecast during the day and change your plans to suit the weather.

Fire and emergency with NIWA have developed an online website  [[Click here](https://fireweather.niwa.co.nz/)]  which displays the current and forecast fire weather conditions. The website is scalable so works on a PC, tablet, phone or any other device with an internet connection.

<br />

The webpage has a Geolocation tool built into it so you can access the fire weather information from the field. 

## Step 1:    Use the link to check: [Click here](https://fireweather.niwa.co.nz/)

![Module 13 - Figure 1](/assets/img/module13_Fig1.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 2:  Click on the drop down _“select a region”_ or click on the map

![Module 13 - Figure 2](/assets/img/module13_Fig2.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 3:  As a member of the public or farmer, you will be looking at the fire dangers using the “general” tab on the right hand side

![Module 13 - Figure 3](/assets/img/module13_Fig3.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 4:  Click on your location on the map, a small window will appear showing the current and forecast fire danger from the nearest weather station for this location

![Module 13 - Figure 4](/assets/img/module13_Fig4.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 5:  The table below the map, shows further detailed weather information from each of the weather stations in your region.

This table shows the fire danger classes for forest, scrub and grass vegetation, along with the fuel dryness codes, and the fire behaviour indices. It also shows the hourly weather parameters that drive these codes and indices.  With an understanding of fire behaviour you can see whether it is fuel dryness, and/or the temperatures, humidity and wind strength driving the fire dangers.

<br />

<br />

## Step 6:  By clicking on the yellow slide bar, you can view what the forecast fire weather is for this afternoon, or out to the next six days.  Note that forecasts are only reliable for the first two days out and you need to regularly check every day leading up to burning.

<br />

**Aside:**  You can click on the small calendar and can look back at the historical weather for your after-action reviews.

### Alternatives to FWSYS
While NIWA and MetService provide good sources of information on weather forecasting, and monitoring the fire danger daily or hourly (NIWA fire website). You can also view more frequent current weather data using the Harvest site.  You can  track weather parameters from the nearest weather station, which updates every10mins.  This site also has basic weather forecasts out to 10 days using Weather Underground.

## Step 1: [Click here](https://nrfa.harvest.com/) to visit the Harvest

![Module 13 - Figure 8](/assets/img/module13_Fig8.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 2:  select your sub-region and nearest weather station (unit) from the top drop-down bars. 

![Module 13 - Figure 9](/assets/img/module13_Fig9.png)

<br />

![Module 13 - Figure 10](/assets/img/module13_Fig10.png)

<br />

<br />

## Step 3:  scroll down the page until you get to the graphs, if you move your mouse over from side to side you’ll get the 10 min readings

![Module 13 - Figure 11](/assets/img/module13_Fig11.png)

<br />

**Note:**  If you are not sure of your nearest unit:
* you can click on the FENZ map in the right hand side of the website,
* or use this link: [Click here](https://fenz.harvest.com/?cmd=googlemap&map_id=432&sid=7842) and hold the control button on the keyboard, and use the mouse to scroll in and out to find your location on the map.

`Need to have a link to the explanation of what the fire dangers mean, and what you can and can’t do,  - CROSS LINK TO module on fire codes and indicies`


`NOTE:  video someone going to and getting weather out of these sites for an explanation. With a voice over to explain what and why. Perhaps put on youtuebe or embed these videos`

### Learning outcome: 

Understanding the need to look at multiple sources and where to get fire weather data (current and forecasted).
