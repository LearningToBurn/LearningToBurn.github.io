### If a fire escapes

Having appropriate fire suppression resources on hand, enables a quick response to a fire escape, increasing the chances of suppressing the fire in its early stages. As the fire progresses, the risk of fire behaviour escalating and/or changing increases.

It is recommended to only attack the fire if you have been trained by an NZQA-accredited training provider in the use of the equipment, and it is safe to do so. Otherwise you should immediately evacuate and call the Emergency 111 Number.

FENZ is responsible for all fire response and suppression. It may be necessary to work with FENZ to create fire breaks with heavy farm machinery, water tanks with rural hose couplings, and make sure this equipment is up to date if a fire was to break out.

Only attempt to fight the fire if it is safe to do so and you are confident you can contain it. Otherwise phone 111 immediately and give clear information of your:
* Address,
* Road name
* RAPID number
* Approximate area burnt
* What is burning
* What is at risk
* Wind direction and strength.

### Personnel resources

* When planning your burn ensure that there are sufficient personnel to deal with an initial response to a fire escape
* Personnel should be trained and competent in using fire suppression tools and techniques and have the correct clothing and PPE (Link to clothing module)
* There should be sufficient food and water supplies at the site (beyond what is needed for the prescribed burn) to support the fire fighting crew.

### Equipment resources `add photos?`

Think about what equipment you will need to suppress a fire should it escape. The equipment should be checked and tested to ensure that it is in full working order prior to starting the burn. It is important to have the right equipment on site and set up before you start your burn as a fire can get out of control very rapidly. Ensure your tools remain close by as you conduct the burn, just in case they are needed.

### Hand tools

Hand tools can be extremely effective in firefighting operations.  Hand tools are:
* useful for putting out small fires and hotspots,
* best used to clear light fuels
* most effective when used in conjunction with other fire suppression tools such as water,
* best restricted to daytime use.

**Shovels** work best in coarse textured, loose soils and where vegetation cover is light. Shovels can be used to:
* construct and/or clear firebreaks
* create fire lines
* dig out underground smouldering fires
* beat out flames
* cover hot spots or immovable smouldering objects with soil to smother flames, and
* clear water points.
* Shovels can also be used to help dig out stuck vehicles.

**Rakes** work best in light fuels with low fire intensity and when used behind a water source, suppressing any fire that may still be burning or rekindling. Rakes are used to:
* scrape surface fuels off a fire line
* raking litter and vegetation into the burnt area
* scrape bark from tree trunks 
* rake out hot coals from logs and stumps.  

**Axes** work best in construction of a fire line; they are used to:
* split open logs and stumps, 
* cut through branches and small logs, 
* fell small trees 
* clean bark from trees.

**Pulaski** is used for constructing firebreaks and can both dig the soil and split open and rake out logs or stumps. The Pulaski is a special hand tool used in fighting fires which combines an axe and an adze. 

**Power tools** such as chainsaws and brush cutters can be used to clear light fuels. 
* Brush cutters are effective at cutting a fire line through light vegetation 
* Chainsaws can be used to fell larger scrub to clear a fire line or gain access for fire hoses. Care should be taken when operating the chainsaw near hot spots as the air movement created by the saw may unintentionally spread the fire.


**Portable extinguishers**
Portable fire extinguishers come in a range of sizes and weights. It is important to consider the person who is likely to be carrying it and the nature in which it is to be used. Ensure that it is maintained regularly, and you know how to operate it. Lack of maintenance can lead to an extinguisher not discharging when required or rupturing when pressurized.

### Pumping Units

Pumping units range from simple backpack sprayer units through to units for pickup and ATV/UTV.

**Knapsack/backpack sprayers** are most useful in the initial stages of fire suppression, for extinguishing small spot fires and embers, dampening down firebreaks and hose lines laid through burnt areas and in mopping up operations. sprayers are more efficient and effective if the refill station is nearby and when used in combination with hand tools. They are less effective and efficient in suppressing larger fires.

**Water tanks and pump units** for utes and ATVâ€™s
All-terrain vehicles and utility-type vehicles fitted with water tank and pump units are versatile vehicles for fire suppression. They carry crew members rapidly around the burn site, transport and deliver water for extinguishing fires, assist with communication efforts, and can traverse steep terrain. They can also be used to refill monsoon buckets for aerial (helicopter) applications.

Water tank and pump units need to be the correct size and weight for the vehicle you are planning to put it in, to avoid damage to the vehicle. The tank should be mounted in a sturdy steel frame and securely fasted to the bed with hooks and tie-downs. Tanks should be positioned near the center of gravity between the axles, generally directly behind the cab. Tanks should capable of releasing large quantities of water rapidly in case the vehicle gets stuck. Consider lightweight materials such as fiberglass or plastic as they are easier to manoeuvre. Do not overload the vehicle, stay within the recommended cargo weight when filling water tanks. An over-weighted vehicle is very dangerous to the driver and those around them.

The pump engine should operate independently of the vehicle engine so that water can be pumped even if the vehicle engine stalls or stops. This can be important for saving the vehicle and crew if fire should surround a stuck vehicle. All pumping system components should be compatible, durable, and capable of being rapidly adjusted.

Have sufficient stores of fuel (i.e. petrol and diesel) and critical spare parts on site.

### Heavy machinery and aircraft  

Prior to the burn, identify the availability, details and capability of heavy machinery and aircraft that would be available to respond to a fire escape. Have all contact details on site, the location of the machinery and aircraft and estimated time to reach the burn site.

Heavy machinery is usually brought in to deal with larger uncontrolled fires; examples include tractors, bulldozers, excavators, skidders or graders. They can be used to establish and clear fire lines, build access tracks and clear safety zones.

Helicopters are the main aircraft used at fires; identify and prepare an appropriate helicopter landing site as part of your burn plan. Helicopters are used to transport personnel and equipment, survey the fire scene and to carry water (and retardants). Monsoon buckets are specialist items used with helicopters to rapidly deliver large volumes of water on to the fire in difficult places. They drop loads of water to knock down surface flame so that ground crews can get into and extinguish the fire. 

Some fixed wing aircraft have been modified to transport water supplies to a fire. They are also capable of dropping large quantities of water in a single water drop.

### Water resources and fire suppressants

**Water**
Water is the best and most effective fire control method. Before starting any burn, check that you have a reliable supply of water to deal with a fire escape. Consider factors such as location and distance away from the burn, accessibility by vehicles, machines and aircraft, cleanliness and volume. A reliable water supply is essential for rapid effective fire suppression and control in the event of an escape and for creating and maintaining effective control lines in fuel vegetation. Water resources can include dams, rivers, lakes, ponds, water races, tanks or reservoirs. 

**Fire suppressants**
For large out of control fires, FENZ will use foam, soap capsules and retardants as fire suppressants. These are chemicals are added to water to reduce the surface tension of water causing it to spread across surfaces more easily, allowing greater penetration into the vegetation and increased coverage. The use of a wetting agent increases the effectiveness of the water, reducing the amount of water used. Fire suppressants are used to stop unburnt fuel from burning and are sprayed on to vegetation ahead of the flames as a firebreak. They can be used on the fire head, flanks, control lines, or to assist with burnout operations. The water in the mixture evaporates, leaving the retardant that resists combustion.
 
Be prepared to let FENZ know what equipment is available and the nearest location. The sooner the fire escape is detected and the details on location and size are communicated, the greater the opportunity for suppression.

### Other resources

* **Communication equipment** for all personnel: good reliable communication equipment is critical when dealing with a fire escape. Radios are preferred over mobile phones. Effective communication is needed to establish a clear chain of command and lines of responsibility.
* **Maps** that show the location of water supplies, firebreaks, natural fire barriers, access routes, helicopter landing pad and hazards
* **Weather forecast** updates
